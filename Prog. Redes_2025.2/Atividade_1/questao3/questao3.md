  That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
  
  Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0067_triangle.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

  *NOTE:* This is a much more difficult version of [Project Euler - Problem 18](https://projecteuler.net/problem=18). It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are $2^{99}$ altogether! If you could check one trillion ($10^{12}$) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
